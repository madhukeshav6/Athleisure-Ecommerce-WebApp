SECTION 2: API BASICS

01) Created ASP.NET Core Web API project

02) Created the controller class for Products 
	: ProductsController
	
03) Created the Entity class for Products 
	: Entities.Products

04) Installing NuGet packages for "API" project:
	: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqllite
	: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
	
05) Created the DbContext clas to represent a session with the database
	: StoreContext
	[Also see: Unit of work and repository pattern]
	
06) Configured the connection string for SqlLite connection.
	: appsettings.Development.json
	
07) Registered the DbContext and the configured connection string in Step 6 to the dependency injection container.
	: Program
	
08) Creating the migration files and updating the database using Entity Framework's migration and populating it with data (writing manual query).

09) Querying the data from the controller class.
	: ProductsController -> GetProducts, GetProduct
	[Also see: Section 2, Video 15 of the Udemy course for a good explanation of the working and Dependency injection].
	
10) Importing Postman collections.

11) Creating Infrastructure and Core projects and re-organizing the entire project.

12) Creating a github repository and updating it.

SECTION 3: API ARCHITECTURE

1) Theory on the Repository Pattern
	[Also see: Section 3, Video 21 of the Udemy course for a very good explanation on this]
	
2) Added an interface to implement the repository pattern for products and added a class that implements the interface. Registered the interface and it's class implementation with the DI container.
	: IProductRepository, ProductRepository
	
3) Updated the controller to use the repository instead of the DbContext directly.

4) Created/Extended Entities for products
	: BaseEntity, Product, ProductType, ProductBrand
	
5) Added these new entities as DbSets to StoreContext
	: StoreContext

6) Generated migrations for these new entities.
